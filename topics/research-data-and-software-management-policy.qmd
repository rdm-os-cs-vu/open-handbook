title: Research Data and Software Management Policy
---
VU Amsterdam considers the careful handling of research data and software to be very important. The university has therefore formulated a Research Data and Software Management Policy which articulates how to handle research data and software. The policy lists the responsibilities regarding research data and software management for researchers, department heads, faculty boards and the university as a whole.

* VU Research Data and Software Management Policy (2024) in [English](../public/policies-regulations/RDSM-policy-VU-EN-v3.0.pdf) and in [Dutch](../public/policies-regulations/RDSM-policy-VU-NL-v3.0.pdf)

Since the VU Amsterdam policy for Research Data and Software Management is formulated in general terms, faculties have worked out more detailed policies and guidelines for their own faculty. These faculty-specific guidelines can be found below.

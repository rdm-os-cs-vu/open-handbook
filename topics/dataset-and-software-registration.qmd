## Registration & Findability

When you have finished finalizing a dataset or research software and are ready to archive it, there are many options available. Depending on the research and choices made earlier the archive provides the option to fill in descriptive fields for a dataset. The descriptions in the archives often are automatically created using metadata standards like DataCite or Dublin Core, or some other type of standard. See also section [Metadata](../topics/metadata.qmd)

When registering a dataset or research software in an archive it is important to use unique identifiers to allow for increased findability and easy attribution & citation. Examples of this are:

* **Personal names**: try to consistently use the same notation for all researchers and assistants that are included as authors
* **ORCID**: using a unique identifier like this for all authors is recommended. More information is [available here](https://libguides.vu.nl/orcid).
* **Institutional names**: avoid using different versions (or language versions) of participating Institutes/organisations and departments. In the case of the VU the official written name is: Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. For each organisation or Institute that is included: try to make sure that the official name is used each time.

Some archives also allow you to preregister your project/dataset/software. Examples are:

* [Open Science Framework](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/sections/360003624093-Create-Registrations) (OSF) Registration
* [Zenodo & registration](https://zenodo.org/deposit)

## Register your Dataset/Software in PURE

Just like your publications, data that you have collected for your research constitute research output, too. Therefore you are required to record your datasets and research software in PURE. Your datasets and research software can be of interest to others, which can in turn lead to new collaboration opportunities. Datasets and research software recorded in PURE also appear in reports that are used for research evaluations. Even if access to your dataset and research software is closed, you are required to register your dataset and research software in PURE. It is a record of the research, data collection and analysis that you have carried out.

### Benefits of recording your dataset/software in PURE

* It increases the visibility and findability of your datasets and research software
* It contributes to re-use and transparency
* It boosts your collaboration opportunities
* It counts towards research evaluations and assessments

### How to register your dataset/software in PURE?

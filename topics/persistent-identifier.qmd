title: Persistent Identifier
---

A persistent identifier (PID) is a durable reference to a digital dataset document, website or other object. It is a kind of [ISBN](https://www.isbn.org/about_isbn_standard) for digital files. By using a persistent identifier, you make sure that your dataset will be findable well into the future. A [DOI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) or [Handle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handle_(computing)) are the commonly used PIDs. The [data archiving options](../topics/selecting-data.qmd) at VU Amsterdam commonly offer DOIs.

Most data archives or repositories offer a persistent identifier and generate this automatically when research data are archived. For example, this is the case for DataverseNL at VU Amsterdam. In Yoda at VU Amsterdam, assigning a PID is possible, but does not happen automatically. Please get in touch with the [RDM Support Desk](mailto:rdm@vu.nl) if you have questions about assigning a PID when you archive data in Yoda.

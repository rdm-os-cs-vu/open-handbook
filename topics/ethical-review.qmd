title: Ethical Review
---

In cases where research involves human or animal participants, a research proposal may need to be reviewed by an ethics committee. VU Amsterdam and Amsterdam UMC (location VUmc), have several ethics committees, which are listed below. Please note that researchers at VU Amsterdam also have to go to the METc at VUmc if their research is [subject to the WMO](https://english.ccmo.nl/investigators/legal-framework-for-medical-scientific-research/your-research-is-it-subject-to-the-wmo-or-not), which is not restricted to research at VUmc.

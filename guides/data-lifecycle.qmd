## Support

### Research Data Services

![Image showing the relations between VU Research Data Support Offices, at the center with grants, legal, library, security, IT for Research, and IXA around it.](../public/VU-research-data-service-offices.png)

Research Data Management is supported by various departments at VU Amsterdam. These departments will help all VU researchers. There are also faculty specific support departments for research data support; they support their own faculty members.

Here you find references to other organisational units and departments that can help you with matters related to collecting and managing data.

## SURFsara

![SURFsara logo](../public/surf_sara.png)

SURF is the collaborative organisation for ICT in Dutch education and research. SURF offers advanced ICT services specifically for researchers. You can start using some of these services right away with your VU credentials. For others you have to get in touch with SURF yourself. Please check [SURF's website](https://www.surf.nl/en) and the pages about the specific services below for more information.

SURF's services are listed on this page.

### Data services

SURF offers a wide range of services for different phases in the life cycle of your research data. Everything for the secure storage, management, sharing and reuse of data.

* [Research Drive](https://www.surf.nl/en/research-drive-securely-and-easily-store-and-share-research-data): securely and easily store and share research data.
  * Does your research team need large storage quotas, a secure environment to store personal and/or sensitive data, and work collaboratively with other educational and governmental institutions or external private parties? Research Drive is a cloud-based shared-storage environment specifically designed for these requirements.
* [SURFfilesender](https://www.surf.nl/en/surffilesender-send-large-files-securely-and-encrypted): send large files securely and encrypted.
  * Want to send and receive files quickly, securely and easily? With SURFfilesender, you can send large files, such as research data. The files are stored in the Netherlands. Encryption provides added security.
* Secure, long-term storage with [Data Archive](https://www.surf.nl/en/services-and-products/data-archive/index.html).
  * The Data Archive is the centralised location for data archiving and (long-term) storage. You can securely store research data there, even in volumes running into the petabytes. The archive provides quick access to SURFsara's computing facilities.
* [Data Persistent Identifier](https://www.surf.nl/en/services-and-products/data-persistent-identifier/index.html): data always findable by permanent references.
  * Persistent identifiers (PIDs) ensure the findability of your data, now and always. PIDs are comparable to the ISBN numbers assigned to books. Even if the location or underlying infrastructure changes, the reference path remains intact. SURFsara offers the PID service in cooperation with the European Persistent Identifier Consortium (EPIC).

### Data processing and analysis (see also 'Computing')

* [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.surf.nl/en/jupyter-notebook-accessible-and-interactive-data-analysis-for-research-and-education): accessible and interactive data analysis for research and education.
  * A Jupyter Notebook is an interactive web application that you can use to create documents, known as notebooks, that contain computer code, formatted text, comparisons and visualisations. The code can be executed in the environment and you can even create streaming applications and dashboards.

### Computing

Do you encounter limitations with your own systems? SURF offers researchers a wide range of services in the field of high performance computing (HPC): thousands of times faster than your PC.

* [Snellius: National Super Computer](https://www.surf.nl/en/services/snellius-the-national-supercomputer).
  * It is the most comprehensive system in the field of capability computing in the Netherlands. Snellius is especially in high demand for its combination of fast processors and internal network, large storage capacity and the ability to process large datasets.
* [SURF Research Cloud](../topics/researchcloud.qmd): your flexible compute infrastructure.
  * SURF Research Cloud gives you and your project team complete control over your computing infrastructure. The infrastructure ranges from a single work station to a complete cluster and can be expanded to suit your needs. You can use your own operating system and analysis software. HPC Cloud is housed in SURF's own data centre.
* [Grid](https://www.surf.nl/en/services-and-products/grid/index.html): for processing and storing large datasets.
  * Do you want to process and store large- amounts of data? The Grid may very well be suitable for your project. The grid infrastructure consists of a large number of clusters for computing and data storage, which are interconnected via a fast network.
* [Visualisation](https://www.surf.nl/en/services-and-products/visualisation/index.html): more insight into your data.
  * Do you want to analyse, process or visualise complex research data or big data? These services give you insight into your research data. SURF's Visualisation service allows you to visualise your own datasets on your desktop. This makes it easy to identify connections between data or gain other insight into your datasets. SURFsara offers a powerful remote visualisation service that combines high performance with ease of use.
* [Collaboratorium](https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/collaboratorium): a visualisation and presentation space for science and industry.

### Expertise, advice and training

SURF offers advice and training on their services. Their training sessions are announced in the [SURF Agenda](https://www.surf.nl/en/agenda/research-and-ict).

* [SURF Training courses for research](https://www.surf.nl/en/training-courses-for-research).
  * Want to get started with SURF systems but lack the necessary knowledge? SURF regularly organizes hands-on systems training courses at their offices in Utrecht and Amsterdam or at your education or research institution. You can also include the training courses in the educational programme of your institution.
* [SURF Consultancy](https://www.surf.nl/en/services-and-products/consultancy/index.html) on ICT solutions for researchers.
  * SURFsara possesses a wealth of experience in the field of ICT services for researchers. If you need help developing/improving your application or designing your infrastructure, then you've come to the right place. SURF experts will be happy to lend their expertise to support your research.

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>On October 30th, 2024, all authors participated in the fourth hackathon for the Research Support Handbook. Since the <a href="https://rdm.vu.nl/blog/2024-09-30hackathon.html">third hackathon</a>, we migrated to <code>rdm.vu.nl</code>, which is a huge milestone! üéâ</p>
<p>For the fourth hackathon, we focused on tying up loose ends that we accumulated. The migration means we are now in a stable state, yet there is always more work to be done. During this hackathon, we focused on picking up stale discussions, reviewing open pull requests, and generally closing issues that we took too long to revisit.</p>
<p>We considered how (un)balanced the various <a href="https://rdm.vu.nl/topics.html">Topics</a> had gotten, because we want readers to be able to form consistent expectations. We observed that some topics are related to tools, others to concepts. Some topics are concise, whereas others are lengthy.</p>
<p>One breakout group focused on creating templates for both kinds of topics, resulting in an initial structure that will make it easier to start new topics in the future. Specifically we propose the following template structure for tools (for example, Qualtrics, HPC, DMPonline):</p>
<ul>
<li>What is it?</li>
<li>What can it be used for?</li>
<li>How to request access</li>
<li>Are there costs involved</li>
<li>Getting started (with screenshot)</li>
<li>How does it work/more detailed instructions</li>
<li>Contact</li>
</ul>
<p>And the following structure for concepts (for example, DMP, data citation, data storage):</p>
<ul>
<li>What is it</li>
<li>Examples</li>
<li>Tools/services/resources related to concept provided by VU</li>
<li>How does this help you in your research?</li>
</ul>
<p>We will follow up with a new hackathon in late november.</p>

  <title>Why was rdm.vu.nl down for ten hours?</title>
  <dc:creator>Chris Hartgerink</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>On Friday October 18th 2024, we experienced around ten hours of downtime on the <code>rdm.vu.nl</code> website. The downtime started around 10AM after merging changes to the handbook and was resolved the same day, by 8PM.<sup>1</sup></p>
<section id="root-cause" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="root-cause">Root cause</h2>
<p>The downtime started after merging changes to the handbook in commit <a href="https://github.com/ubvu/open-handbook/commit/669b06528731f95566d605d65b9c3a507f58bced">669b065</a>. These changes themselves, did not cause the downtime. The root cause was an incorrect configuration in the deployment of the webpage, which inadvertently removed the <code>rdm.vu.nl</code> domain name from the GitHub settings every time we made changes in the handbook and redeployed the website. This resulted in 404 errors that the page could not be found.</p>
<p>We first observed this issue on Thursday, one day prior to the downtime, in commit <a href="https://github.com/ubvu/open-handbook/commit/678ff8843dc018f76661b24ee25c64bff5c459df">678ff88</a>. We proposed a fix for this issue in <a href="https://github.com/ubvu/open-handbook/pull/220">#220</a>, before the downtime started.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-could-the-downtime-happen-if-the-fix-was-clear" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-could-the-downtime-happen-if-the-fix-was-clear">How could the downtime happen if the fix was clear?</h2>
<p>The fix for the domain specification was not merged in time for two reasons.</p>
<section id="reason-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reason-1">Reason 1</h3>
<p>At this time, we require two reviews before merging changes to the handbook. The fix was proposed at 1.11PM on Thursday, and did not receive the required reviews by the time the downtime happened (reason 1). However, this was a technical administration task and could have been merged immediately, as this supercedes regular review procedures.</p>
</section>
<section id="reason-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reason-2">Reason 2</h3>
<p>The domain specification fix was not immediately merged to allow time to pass and ensure the fix was appropriate upon further reflection. This is because administrator <span class="citation" data-cites="chartgerink">(<strong>chartgerink?</strong>)</span> both proposed the fix and would also be the one to supercede the ‚Äútwo reviews‚Äù requirement. Due to travel, the administrator forgot about it in the morning, and only saw the messages about the downtime at 8PM. At that time, the fix was quickly merged and the downtime resolved.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="improvements" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="improvements">Improvements</h2>
<p>The domain configuration is corrected and the deployment ensures the domain name is re-added to the GitHub settings every time there are changes to the handbook. This is now automated, which ensures that the domain name will not be removed inadvertently when future changes are incorporated.</p>
<p>However, we also learned that critical administration fixes should not be left open for longer than is absolutely necessary. Here it was left open for longer than absolutely necessary due to travel, and a second administrator could have caught this issue sooner. This means we should work towards resilient reporting mechanisms to escalate such critical issues, and build capacity in the editor team to ensure no one person is responsible for merging critical fixes that are already available.</p>

<section id="acknowledgements" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>We would like to thank the editors for dealing with the stress from this inadvertent issue. We also thank the community for their patience as we only recently migrated to <code>rdm.vu.nl</code> and figure out these initial unexpected hurdles.</p>

<p>In the third hackathon for the Research Support Handbook, held on September 25th, 2024, contributors gathered to make significant progress towards migrating the handbook to the VU domain (rdm.vu.nl). The event centered around sprinting to a finish line by refining existing content and ensuring accessibility standards are met.</p>
<p>Key activities included:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Proofreading and Topic Refinement</strong>: Participants reviewed existing topics to ensure clarity and focus. This led to the realization that some topics, like ‚ÄúData Publication,‚Äù would benefit from being split into more specific subtopics, such as ‚ÄúOpen Science‚Äù or ‚ÄúSoftware Licensing.‚Äù</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Guide Titles Revision</strong>: We started normalizing guide titles into questions, making navigation easier and more value informed. We ideated options for guides now titled ‚ÄúPlan &amp; Design‚Äù to be converted into actionable questions like ‚ÄúHow do I plan for managing my data?‚Äù</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Alt Text Improvement</strong>: We reviewed existing alt texts for images and refined them to ensure accessibility. We also identified some remaining images that had no alt text, and added it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Image Selection</strong>: Contributors identified and proposed openly licensed images to enhance the visual appeal of the guides, with some creative choices from <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11147887">Zenodo‚Äôs RDM LEGO collection</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="bres_2024_11147887">(Bres and Bittner 2024)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, the hackathon was a productive session, and the handbook is now in its final stage, with the team preparing for the official launch on &lt;rdm.vu.nl&gt;. In next hackathons, we may focus on splitting existing topics and adding new ones, as our list of idea topics is growing rapidly.</p>

<p>On September 5th, 2024, all authors participated in the second hackathon for the Research Support Handbook. For this hackathon, we focused on quality assurance. Quality assurance is crucial in ensuring that all parties at VU Amsterdam feel confident adopting this evolving, community-led resource as an official university page. Our goal is to migrate the handbook to rdm.vu.nl in the near future, which requires us to everything is in tip-top shape.</p>
<p>Collectively, we proofread the migrated LibGuide pages. The result of this are seven GitHub issues and nine pull requests for revisions. These include <a href="https://github.com/ubvu/open-handbook/issues/125">making sure all images are migrated into the handbook</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ubvu/open-handbook/issues/124">ensuring appropriate page titles</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ubvu/open-handbook/issues/131">refining the contribution guide</a>.</p>
<p>During the hackathon, we observed a lot of links in <a href="https://libguides.vu.nl/rdm">the old LibGuide resource</a>, are broken. We did some much needed maintenance work during the hackathon, given that the Research Support Handbook will replace the LibGuide resource. We identified broken links and replaced them where possible. There is a need to make this a less manual process in the future and will seek out automations to help us maintain the links moving forward. Additionally, there are many internal links that need updating, changing from LibGuide URLs to GitHub pages. We also discovered several links accessible only with university credentials, which we believe detract from the user experience; these links will require special labeling and contextualization.</p>
<p>The general sentiment at the end of the hackathon is that there is still lots of work to do. The community standards are manifesting themselves, and it is clear that pathways need more work to be production ready. These discussions surfaced a wish to have more frequent hackathons at this time, until the standards are set and the included content is ready for rdm.vu.nl.</p>

<p>On June 27th, 2024, the first hackathon for the Research Support Handbook took place with all the post authors. For this hackathon, we focused on non-GitHub based contributions, to make it as easy as possible to contribute. To make getting started with contributing easier, <a href="https://ubvu.github.io/open-handbook/public/20240627hackathon.html">we created a choose your own adventure game</a>. We document some lessons and clarifications below, in addition to <a href="https://github.com/ubvu/open-handbook/issues?q=created%3A2024-06-27">the twelve reported problems and suggested changes</a>.</p>
<p>The workshop helped articulate the <strong>dynamic relation between topics and pathways</strong>. Topics are contained pages around a specific subject; pathways are a collection of topics. This means that pathways include the topics directly and that this content should be up to date at any given time. When topics are changed, pathways are dynamically updated, making sure there are no discrepancies. The only situation where this may not be the case, is when a pathway is still a work in progress and the topics are not yet properly linked.</p>
<p>Pathways will become more efficient to create as we include more topics in the handbook. Given that pathways are primarily collections of topics, this means that there is barely any new content in there, if any at all. As we include more topics (eight at this time), pathways can focus more and more on the structuring of content, and focus less on creating the content itself.</p>
<p>With new contributions, contributors surfaced the need to preview the changes to the handbook. We documented two ways to render the handbook for such previews: (1) creating a Pull Request automatically deploys a preview website and (2) running <code>quarto render</code> locally on the code. Option 1 requires no additional software to be installed, but requires some knowledge of GitHub. Option 2 does not require much knowledge of GitHub, but requires the Quarto software to be installed. There was also the note that deploying the handbook using GitHub pages required a change to the URL, which may cause issues when merging the changes back into the main handbook. This highlights that ensuring reliable previews of contributed content is of importance to some contributors to the handbook.</p>
<p>Lastly, the hackathon surfaced many questions and discussions around the collaborative decisions that will need to be made. When does a topic become too long and should it be split up into multiple topics? Can a topic include subtopics? How is the GitHub environment maintained? How much technical expertise is necessary to ensure the content does not go offline? What contributor roles are there and who has which role? How do roles get distributed and can people volunteer for them? This highlights the engagement with the handbook, and we encourage everyone (including ourselves) to generously surface these discussions in issues or in a next hackathon.</p>
<p>In summary, the first hackathon is a success! This is the start of the next phase of the handbook journey, moving from design and scaffolding to nurturing and growing the contents. There will be more hackathons, and these will be announced on this blog and on other channels at VU Amsterdam. Until the next one!</p>
